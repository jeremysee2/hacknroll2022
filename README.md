# Hack and Roll 2022

This is a bot for the Most Annoying Hack entry for the Hack and Roll 2022 hackathon.

## Functionality

Send it any message and it will reply with a quote generated from the [Wisdom of Chopra](http://wisdomofchopra.com/) website, straight to your telegram account! Built using [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and the `requests` library in python.

## How is it annoying?

Well if you do it enough times it can stop becoming funny and be really annoying. Even better if you add it to a group chat and all it does is send random almost-comprehensible quotes!
